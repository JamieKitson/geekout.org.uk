Bought a [SPOT connect](http://www.findmespot.com/en/index.php?cid=116) _geek
gadget_ so that you can track our progress and we can post short <41char
updates!

I bought the device from a UK distributor [Global Telesat
Communications](http://www.globaltelesat.co.uk/) and I found it a tough
decision to purchase, because the hardware costs 150GBP and the upkeep is 100+
GBP a year plus extras. Extras like a SOS extraction service I've yet to figure
out.

After receiving the device (which I've since called _puck_) in London, I tried
it though I frustratingly couldn't get a message out. The [Android
application](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.spotllc.spotconnect.app)
was a little disappointing, and to actually send a message doesn't seem
instant. It seems to queue up and sends it over a ~10 minute interval... So the
whole experience from the [Spot connect Android
client](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.spotllc.spotconnect.app) is a
bit ridiculous. Watch bluetooth sap the Nexus S's battery until the message
finds a window to be sent (perhaps).  There is no confirmation on the client
itself whether it sent or not, only on the puck itself, when it blinks red,
meaning that it failed...

Later in Steyning, I managed to send a couple of messages (to **great relief**),
though they did not appear on a "Public shared map" I created:

So far the SPOT service does seem quite unpolished, though I hope their
customer services will come through. My next biggest concern is how long the
batteries work. 2x[AA batteries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AA_battery) will
track [[Team Geekout|about]] for how long ?
