So after our early start we headed for Novosibirsk and the road was fine.

We made a wrong turning getting into **Lenina**, the place to hang about and
ended up having to cross the river Ob (strangely the same name as "water" in
Persian) and I was furious. Traffic was pretty awful.

Anyway, after that navigation blunder (google maps routing does not work here)
we did find parking and we nervously checked into Centralnaya Hotel.
Centralnaya looked like a typical Soviet hotel and it is. However it's the best
run hotel of its kind. Its a little dear, but those of us who have had
nightmares staying in similar looking hotels should try this. Everything works.
Including Internet. And it has a fantastic central location.

We then had a leisurely lunch at "Pechki Lavochki", an excellent Russian
restaurant a few doors up. The [food was
great](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6099029161/) and it was just so
awesome not to be in some shithole for lunch or eating Ramen (again) on the
road.

In 2004 I took this photo of Novosibirsk's theatre

Again in 2011, the roads are better and the roof is looking good. Otherwise,
nothing has changed drastically like Kazakhstan, which personally I find
comforting.

Later [Kas](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/73378480/), a friend of Ivan
who hosted [Antoine](http://delaunay.org/antoine/) and I when we toured the
region in 2004, met Jamie and I, team Geekout.

He asked us lots of questions about the [Mongol
Rally](http://www.theadventurists.com/the-adventures/mongol-rally), and like my
other journalist friend in Kazakhstan, seemed to have little idea that 300 or
so teams are gallivanting across their backyard!

Later his colleague met with us from their [Novosibirsk news
site](http://news.ngs.ru/), asking us about our impressions of the town, since
not many tourists come here. Tbh I think Novosibirsk has a lot going for it:

* It's on the trans-siberian railroad
* It's not an overbearing city like Moscow or St. Petersburg
* Great Russian food can be found here
* Best Jazz club in the world here, Tuba
* Providing you have a host or contact, they treat you like gold
* Lots of students and there is some nearby science town

After a lot of good conversation with Kas, his wife & colleague, Jamie and I
wound up in the said Novosibirsk Jazz institution to see some remarkable
impromptu performances by locals. Fantastic stuff.

The next morning we are taking it easy since from this point on, it's camping.
I've now booked my flight out for the 12th to see my
[sister](http://www.flickr.com/photos/juttahendry/) and
[girlfriend](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rcfl).  Jamie is off on the 10th. So
we have _9 days_ to reach [Ulan
Bator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulan_Bator), else Jamie misses his flight
back home to dreary London.  Wish us luck!
