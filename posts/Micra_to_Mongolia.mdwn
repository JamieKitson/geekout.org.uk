All we need now is the car! We are looking to purchase a [2002/2003 Nissan
Micra
Tempest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Micra#Micra_K11C_.281997.E2.80.932003.29)
by the end of the month.

>The K10/K11 generations of Micra were known for reliability, excellent build quality, and user friendliness.

>In What Car?'s Reliability Supertest in 2007, Nissan was ranked 6th out of 26 manufacturers overall, with the K11 Micra (1998â€“2002) being its most reliable model.
