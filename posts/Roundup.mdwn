Jamie and I have been very busy getting the little bits and pieces together for
the Mongol Rally.

Before I start, may I invite you to the [Festival of
Slow](http://mongolrally10.theadventurists.com/index.php?page=festival-of-slow-overview)
at [Goodwood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwood_Circuit) on Saturday the 23
of July to see us off? It would be great if you could make it. :)


* Jamie's sister's boyfriend Josh has made our Micra an awesome [steel sump guard](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiekitson/5925419779)
* Found some [Mongol Rally
statistics](http://www.theadventurists.com/the-jibber/mongol-rally-in-numbers)
with Rob adding: 300 teams and a little over 200 will make it to [UB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulan_Bator) with car
* I'm accredited with a first aid course from [Steve Blethyn](http://www.steveblethyn.co.uk/), so I should be able to keep Jamie alive for a few more minutes
* I'm still [waiting for my Iranian visa](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/5900930968/), as well as Tajikistan & Turkmenistan invite
* Jamie has [[got his new passport|Not_the_Best_Day_of_My_Life]] and is also stressing out with the last few visas
* Complained about the [FCO](http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/) Website and yes, I've accepted the potential risks
* Practiced putting up our [tent](http://www.vango.co.uk/tents/atlas-300.html) (& Jamie took it down)
* Bought some [Korean noodles and supplies](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/5872491113) with the help of Sean and his [fogging machine business](http://www.brown-y.co.uk)
* Ordered some collectible **Team Geek out** calling cards and stickers from <http://uk.moo.com>
* Obtained an [International Drivers Permit](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/5869205510) -- Trivia: I've actually had one before when I first drove in the UK from South Africa
* Moving out of W2 1DS this Thursday, to storage at [Praze Farm](http://prazefarm.co.uk)
* Doing "hand over" for my [work](http://hendry.iki.fi/cv/), [Marcos](http://datadriven.com.au/) will be replacing me. Also about to push out a [Webconverger release](http://webconverger.com)
* Bought a [Central Asia map](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/5897686017/) from [Stanfords](http://www.stanfords.co.uk/) and I've figured out most of the closest / interesting UNESCO sites on the [[route]]!


Have we missed anything? I am so ridiculously excited.
