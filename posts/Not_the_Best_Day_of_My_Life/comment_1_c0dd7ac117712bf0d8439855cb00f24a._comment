i got my passport renewed a couple years ago when it was full - i took it to the passport office in london in person, paid the go faster fee, and it actually got delivered back to my house before I did as I stayed in London that night drinking with friends.  so yes a lot of money extra, but in my case I was very impressed with the service.
