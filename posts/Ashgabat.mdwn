I'm tired, my contacts hurt, it's hot and I am eeking out Internet in the Grand
Turkmenistan lobby surrounded by prostitutes.

Hello from Turkmenistan!

After a long drive from Tehran yesterday, we stayed in Goochan. The next day we
drove hungry to the border. Luckily Jamie stopped for some noodles.

At the border we bumped into a team from Iceland called <http://mud-lab.com/>.
We were thinking we must be one of the last teams. On the top of the Iran side
we bumped into "Team Tigers" and "Two random Germans" who have been stuck
waiting for a Turkmen invitation for days.

The Germans asked to interview us which we agreed to, and after an hour or two
of processing we met them to give an interview. Little did we know the Iranian
official was waiting for us. He came over to us after a few minutes to say
"come back tomorrow". My heart sank and I really though we might be screwed here.

Don't get me wrong, I love Iran and it was a real shame that official decided
to threaten us. Later he did let us cross.

Turkmenistan was sadly almost more farcical than the Iran side. A ton of
bureaucracy and we were through. Unfortunately we had to tell them our EXACT
route and later we thought this might have been a mistake.

Coming down from the mountainous border to Ashgabat was frankly unbelievable.
At first one see a collection of modern-ish white building in the haze. As you
get closer you see architecture that looks like it came out of star wars. Tbh I
quite like the look, but it's just scarily unbelievable. I guess this might be
live Dubai. Most buildings looked wholly unoccupied... ummm this doesn't make
sense.

We drove in convoy with the Icelandic team and we were really worried about
getting our car fined since it was dirty. There is just too much weird stuff in
Turkmenistan for me to give it justice in this blog.

I have a ton of cool video and pictures to upload, but sadly despite checking
into a recommended top pick with Internet. The internet is even WORSE than
Iran, which is a remarkable achievement. I really hope by Uzbekistan things
improve, so we can share more.

Good night... when I wake up... Believe you me it's going to be one of those
WTF moments.
