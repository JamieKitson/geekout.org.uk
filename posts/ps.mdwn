Forgot to mention in <a href="/posts/One_Week_and_Counting/">my last post</a> that both my ex-flatmates are doing <a href="http://mongolia.charityrallies.org/">the other Mongol Rally</a> which is supposed to be more charity and consists of teams driving ambulances all on the same fairly direct route through Ukraine, Russia and Kazakhstan. They contacted me on Thursday asking about Turkey as they were <a href="http://mongoliarally.tumblr.com/post/7647289663/access-denied">stuck at the Ukraine border</a>. They're now going north through Lithuania and Latvia on a bit of a detour.
