They contacted me on Thursday asking about Turkey as they were <a href="http://mongoliarally.tumblr.com/post/7647289663/access-denied">stuck at the Ukraine border</a>. They're now going north through Lithuania and Latvia on a bit of a detour.

I also forgot to mention that Kai's also got himself a special T-shirt too.
