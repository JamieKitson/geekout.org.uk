<p>So after our early start we headed for Novosibirsk and the road was fine.</p>

<p>We made a wrong turning getting into <strong>Lenina</strong>, the place to hang about and
ended up having to cross the river Ob (strangely the same name as "water" in
Persian) again and I was furious. Traffic was pretty awful.</p>

<p>Anyway, after that navigation blunder (google maps routing does not work here)
we did find parking and we nervously checked into Centralnaya Hotel.
Centralnaya looked like a typical Soviet hotel and it is. However it's the best
run hotel of its kind. Its a little dear, but those of us who have had
nightmares staying in similar looking hotels should try this. Everything works.
Including Internet. And it has a fantastic central location.</p>

<p>We then had a leisurely lunch at "Pechki Lavochki", an excellent Russian
restaurant a few doors up. The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6099029161/">food was
great</a> and it was just so
awesome not to be in some shithole for lunch or eating Ramen (again) on the
road.</p>

<p>In 2004 I took this photo of Novosibirsk's theatre</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/73378159/" title="dcp_8932 by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/34/73378159_24f3d7211e.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="dcp_8932"></a></p>

<p>Again in 2011, the roads are better and the roof is looking good. Otherwise,
nothing has changed drastically like Kazakhstan, which personally I find
comforting.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6101624231/" title="Largest theatre in Russia by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6085/6101624231_93e5833b9f.jpg" width="500" height="374" alt="Largest theatre in Russia"></a></p>

<p>Later <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/73378480/">Kas</a>, a friend of Ivan
who hosted <a href="http://delaunay.org/antoine/">Antoine</a> and I when we toured the
region in 2004, met Jamie and I, team Geekout.</p>

<p>He asked us lots of questions about the <a href="http://www.theadventurists.com/the-adventures/mongol-rally">Mongol
Rally</a>, and like my
other journalist friend in Kazakhstan, seemed to have little idea that 300 or
so teams are gallivanting across their backyard!</p>

<p>Later his colleague met with us from their <a href="http://news.ngs.ru/">Novosibirsk news
site</a>, asking us about our impressions of the town, since
not many tourists come here. Tbh I think Novosibirsk has a lot going for it:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's on the trans-siberian railroad</li>
<li>It's not an overbearing city like Moscow or St. Petersburg</li>
<li>Great Russian food can be found here</li>
<li>Best Jazz club in the world here, Tuba</li>
<li>Providing you have a host or contact, they treat you like gold</li>
<li>Lots of students and there is some nearby science town</li>
</ul>

<p>After a lot of good conversation with Kas, his wife &amp; colleague, Jamie and I
wound up in the said Novosibirsk Jazz institution to see some remarkable
impromptu performances by locals. Fantastic stuff.</p>

<p>The next morning we are taking it easy since from this point on, it's camping.
I've now booked my flight out for the 12th to see my
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juttahendry/">sister</a> and
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rcfl">girlfriend</a>.  Jamie is off on the 10th. So
we have <em>9 days</em> to reach <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulan_Bator">Ulan
Bator</a>, else Jamie misses his flight
back home to dreary London.  Wish us luck!</p>
