<h1>Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia</h1>

<p>The tarmacked road from Arvaikheer was pretty uneventful. There were some bad
patches with huge potholes that would probably shock most European drivers, but
by this time Jamie and I have seen (and possibly hit) every state of road
detriment possible.</p>

<p>We <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kaihendry/status/111674161436434432">ate some dry food packs from the
Icelanders</a> and I
must say they were awful compared to Nong Shim with an egg. I am going to miss
our little camp lunches on our butane powered Korean stove.</p>

<p>As we entered Ulaanbaatar we had to navigate bad roads and a ton of traffic.
Painfully but surely we found the Adventurist Mongol Rally finish line. Of
course it was a little anti-climatic. There was no one there to greet us.
Though a fellow rallier who finished a week before, Kathleen from
<a href="http://teamrecklessabandon.org/">http://teamrecklessabandon.org/</a> was passing and congratulated us and gave
us some advice where to stay and eat etc, which was helpful.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6129766746/" title="Our little finish line celebration dinner at a North Korean rest by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6196/6129766746_877a177b23.jpg" width="500" height="374" alt="Our little finish line celebration dinner at a North Korean rest"></a></p>

<p>We settled on Seoul Hotel, checked in and then went for a Korean meal.
Other teams like <a href="http://www.theadventurists.com/the-adventures/mongol-rally/teams/TeamBear">Team
Bear</a>
joined us and surprisingly the restaurant served items from <strong>North Korea</strong>. Joviality ensued
and I thought it was quite a good celebratory dinner.</p>

<p>Later we went to an Irish bar and drank some more. Delightfully I received a call
over Skype from the Icelanders. They had been in town since the morning! They
had taken an overnight bus from Bayankhongor and actually beat us to UB by
several hours.  However they recalled the 15 person minibus carrying 21 people
and a lot of luggage, how cold it was and their "brace ball" position they
adopted for the 13hr journey. So we met at the State department store which is
by far the easiest landmark in UB and went back to Irish bar... to drink some
more.</p>

<p>I became pretty drunk and ended up in some over-forties live music joint a taxi
ride away with Thor &amp; Egill. We suitably partied the night away and entertained
quite a hangover the next day.</p>
